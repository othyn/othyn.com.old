<p>Since I could code and tinker with electronics, I have.</p>

<p>Starting with getting usb modems working and operating system installs, to writing my first application in Visual Basic at around age 12, I have had an innate passion for all things tech.</p>

<p>Through my teen years, I explored all aspects of computing, growing a keen knowledge of everything from power into the machine through to user interaction. Every step in the chain presenting a new avenue to explore and excite. Throughout that period, I explored software, looking at a wide range of languages - fiddling and building a solid knowledge of software design principals and taking part in the open source community. I also built computers. A lot of them - from budget builds to monster workstations. Later looking into virtualisation and home labbing.</p>

<p>Next came the beggings of my still early career, starting as an intern in software development at the beginning of 2014. Within a short time, I was promoted from intern to Web Developer, and then promoted further into my current position, Senior Software Developer. I train, lead and support the next generation of excited Junior Developers, driving my ambition through their passion. I lead, manage and develop a rapidly expanding, award-winning product, delivering the best result for both business and stakeholders.</p>

<p>Software development is my calling, facilitated by my innate ability to quickly consume, understand and distil information to support others. I also have a strong sense of self motivation and passion for high-quality software development, always delivering to a progressive personal standard.</p>

<p>I am devoted. I live and breathe any and all things software and hardware and am pretty much interested in anything that has a plug socket on it; opening it up, tinkering around and seeing how it all works. I love the way I can create and let my mind run wild through, what is usually, a rigid and unforgiving electrical world - but I seem to have a knack for it, I speak its language.</p>

<p>p.s. I may also like Apple. I love all tech, but them.. just a little more. Just an incy bit.</p>
